### Keywords

Each category of commands has their own page which can be found on the sidebar.<br /><br />
**Aliases:** `[option1|option2]` means that you can use either option1 or option2.<br />
**Required:** `<arg>` means that you **need** to specify the argument.<br />
**Optional:** `[arg]` means that you can specify the argument i.e. it is optional.<br />
**Optional with default:** `[arg=default]` means that you can specify the argument with a default value.<br />
**Many:** `<args>` or `[args]` means that you can specify multiple arguments.<br />

Additionally, the bot uses what are called converters which makes specifying roles, members, channels etc easy and fool-proof. When asked to specify a member, you can provide it a mention (pinging the person), an id, their name or their nickname. This principle works for every single command where applicable.
